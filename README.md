2. Clone repository
3. Initialize `git lfs` by running `git lfs install` in the project directory, then pull LFS files with `git lfs pull`
4. Open the project from the Unity Hub or Unity Editor
5. Resolve dependencies

*Note: This project has internal and external dependencies that must be properly configured. Ensure the backend services are up and running before testing the application. The project relies on external services connectivity for full functionality. Some features may not work correctly without proper backend configuration and network access to required external services.*
